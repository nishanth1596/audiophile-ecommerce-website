## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
  - Shipping always adds $50 to the order
  - VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Typescript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React redux toolkit
- React query

### What I learned

This project helped me become more comfortable with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and its utility-first approach to styling. It also deepened my understanding of Flexbox and Grid layout techniques.

### Continued development

I would like to continue practicing more complex layout techniques, especially working with Flexbox and Grid, and further improve my TypeScript skills.

### Useful resources

MDN Web Docs - Flexbox & Grid - This documentation helped me understand Flexbox better.
Tailwind CSS Documentation
Google Fonts - I used the Rubik fonts from Google Fonts to style the text.
